# Unmasking the Culprit: CNN on COVID-19 Patrol
This project presents a deep learning-based COVID-19 detection system leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The system is designed to classify X-ray images of individuals into two categories: COVID-19 positive or non-COVID (normal/healthy).

# Overview
The rapid spread of COVID-19 has highlighted the necessity for efficient diagnostic tools. Radiological imaging, such as X-rays, has shown promise in aiding the identification of COVID-19 cases. This system aims to automate and assist in the diagnosis process by utilizing machine learning techniques.

# Features
## CNN Model: 
Developed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network using Python and popular deep learning library (Keras) to analyze X-ray images for COVID-19 detection.
## GUI Interface: 
Created an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI) using (Tkinter) to enable easy interaction with the trained model. Users can upload X-ray images and get real-time predictions regarding COVID-19 presence.
## Binary Classification: 
The system performs binary classification, distinguishing between COVID-19 positive and negative cases based on learned features extracted from X-ray images.

# Work Flow
## Data Preparation: 
Gathered and preprocessed X-ray images from Kaggle.
## Model Training: 
Developed and trained the CNN model using labeled X-ray images, optimizing for accuracy and robustness.
## GUI Integration: 
Implemented a user-friendly GUI interface that allows users to interact with the model and obtain predictions from X-ray images in real-time.
## Prediction: 
Users can upload X-ray images through the GUI, and the system predicts whether the individual is COVID-19 positive or not.
